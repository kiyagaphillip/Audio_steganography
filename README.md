# Audio_steganography
This project revolves around the development of code for audio steganography, employing the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for discreetly embedding binary data within audio files. This innovative approach focuses on manipulating audio signals in the frequency domain, rendering the hidden data imperceptible to the human ear.
