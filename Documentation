# Audio Steganography using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)

## Overview

This Python code snippet demonstrates the implementation of audio steganography, a technique for hiding binary data within audio files while preserving audio quality. The code utilizes the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to manipulate the frequency domain of the audio signals, making the data embedding process imperceptible to the human ear.

## Features

1. **Audio Input**: The code reads an audio file from Google Drive, allowing users to choose their audio source.

2. **Data Embedding**: It generates a random password, converts it to binary, and accepts user input. Both the password and user input are converted to binary and normalized.

3. **FFT Transformation**: The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is applied to the audio samples to analyze the audio's frequency components.

4. **Data Embedding in Frequency Domain**: The code embeds the binary data (password and user input) into the magnitude spectrum of the FFT. This ensures that the changes in the audio signal occur in the frequency domain and are not easily detectable.

5. **Inverse FFT**: To obtain the modified audio samples, the Inverse FFT (IFFT) is applied to the modified spectrum.

6. **Saving Modified Audio**: The modified audio is saved to a file on Google Drive for further analysis or distribution.

7. **Visualization**: The code includes visualizations to show the differences between the original and modified audio waveforms and spectrograms.

## Usage

1. **Mount Google Drive**: The code mounts Google Drive to access audio files. Users need to run the code in a Google Colab environment.

2. **Audio File**: Users should provide the path to their audio file on Google Drive in the `audio_path` variable.

3. **Password Generation**: A random password is generated by the code for data security.

4. **User Input**: Users can input text that they want to hide within the audio. This input is converted to binary and normalized.

5. **FFT Transformation**: The FFT is applied to the audio samples.

6. **Data Embedding**: The password and user input are embedded into the FFT magnitude spectrum.

7. **Saving Modified Audio**: The modified audio is saved to Google Drive for future use.

8. **Visualization**: The code includes plots to visualize the differences between the original and modified audio.

## Considerations

- Ensure that you run the code in a Google Colab environment or adjust the file paths if running it locally.
- Customize the code to handle your specific audio files and requirements.

## Applications

Audio steganography has applications in secure communication, copyright protection, and covert information exchange. It allows for the discreet transmission of data within audio files, making it a valuable tool in various fields.

## Libraries Used

- NumPy: For numerical operations and array manipulations.
- Matplotlib: For data visualization.
- Librosa: For audio file handling.
- SciPy: For signal processing operations.
- IPython: For displaying audio within the Colab environment.
